<p><strong>TDD</strong> and <strong>BDD</strong> are two widely used software development techniques in which automated testing plays a central role. Today we are going to explore the differences.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with <strong>Test Driven Development</strong>. Typically, in this technique, we write tests for a certain piece of functionality before writing the production code. Then, we run those tests, we wait for them to fail and then we write a code to make the tests pass. This will give us the confidence that our code works. In general, we can say that <strong>TDD</strong> is all about <em>Unit Testing</em>. This approach is mainly focused on achieving high <em>test coverage</em> and answering following questions - <em>is the code working? Was the code/feature implemented?</em> Steps here will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>write a test case based on requirements</li>
<li>write an unit test for the piece of the codebase (functionality) you are planning to create,</li>
<li>execute all existing tests (if any exist) and make sure that only the newly created test is failing. It must fail, as you try to test something that doesn&rsquo;t yet exist,</li>
<li>write production code to make all the tests pass,</li>
<li>refactor your code in order to improve it in general (e.g. it&rsquo;s maintainability, extensibility, readability, efficiency etc.) and to avoid things like duplication,</li>
<li>run all the tests again, to be sure that refactoring didn&rsquo;t break anything.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to <strong>Behavior Driven Development</strong>, usually, it involves developers, test/qa engineers, product managers, business analysts and potentially also other stakeholders. Their task is to discuss the concrete examples of so-called <em>acceptance criteria</em> in a user story. In short, it can be said that the <em>acceptance criteria</em> is a set of conditions, as well as an instruction on how software should function, look and behave to meet the user&rsquo;s needs. To simplify, we can say that this technique is focused on writing acceptance criteria by giving examples of <em>how the software should behave in a certain scenarios</em>. This makes it easier for all stakeholders to collaborate. Most companies use the Given-When-Then approach for this. Let&rsquo;s see an example:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Given</em> - user has provided valid login credentials,</li>
<li><em>When</em> - user has clicked the login button,</li>
<li><em>Then</em> - user gets a message about successful login.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BDD</strong> is a great automated testing practice, as it focuses on <em>customer experience</em> and not only on code/feature implementation. Steps here will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>identify and describe new feature and it&rsquo;s behavior under certain scenarios,</li>
<li>write understandable for everybody steps for each scenario,</li>
<li>write tests based on those scenarios,</li>
<li>implement the respective code,</li>
<li>run tests and check if they are successful. If not, fix the errors. If yes, move further,</li>
<li>refactor your code,</li>
<li>run all the tests again.</li>
</ul>
<p>To summarize, we can say that <strong>TDD</strong> is focused more on unit testing, code/feature implementation and high test coverage, while <strong>BDD</strong> is focused more on user experience and software behavior.</p>
